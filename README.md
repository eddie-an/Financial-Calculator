### Description

A front end web development project. This website performs some financial calculations.

#### Inspiration

After taking a course on engineering economics, I learned about microeconomic & macroeconomic policies as well as interest rate calculations. I wanted to create an application that calculates simple and compounding interest, as well as mortgage payments and annuities.

### Math Equations Used:

#### Simple interest Calculations

To calculate simple interest rate, the following formula and its variation was used

```math
F = P(1 + in)
```

where\
$`F`$ = Future value\
$`P`$ = Principal\
$`i`$ = Interest rate\
$`n`$ = Number of years

#### Compounding interest Calculations

To calculate compounding interest rate, the following formula and its variation was used

```math
F = {P({1 + {r \over n}})}^nt
```

where\
$`F`$ = Future value\
$`P`$ = Principal\
$`r`$ = Annual percentage rate\
$`n`$ = Number of times interest compounded in a year
$`t`$ = Number of years
