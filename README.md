### Description

A front end web development project. This website performs some financial calculations.

#### Inspiration

After taking a course on engineering economics, I learned about microeconomic & macroeconomic policies as well as interest rate calculations. I wanted to create an application that calculates simple and compounding interest, as well as mortgage payments and annuities.

### Math Equations Used:

#### Simple interest Calculations

To calculate simple interest rate, the following formula and its variation was used

```math
F = P(1 + in)
```

where\
$F$ = Future Value\
$P$ = Principal\
$i$ = Interest Rate\
$n$ = Number of Year
